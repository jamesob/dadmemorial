Richard Coleman O'Beirne was born in The Bronx, New York City on September
19, 1948 to James “Lad” O'Beirne, a carpenter and musician, and Mary
(née Coleman) O'Beirne, a nurse, both Irish immigrants from County Sligo.

When Richard was eight years old, his parents moved the family to Woodside,
Queens due to increasing turbulence in the Bronx. Richard showed an early
aptitude for mathematics — while serving detention for tardiness in Catholic
grade school, he would, standing, read math books to pass the time.

He attended Arch Bishop Molloy High School in Briarwood, Queens. During high
school he worked part-time as a paper boy, rising early in the mornings to
assemble newspapers in an empty grocery store.

After graduating Molloy in 1966, he attended Fordham University to pursue
studies in mathematics. While at Fordham, Richard was an ROTC recruit and a
member of the Pershing Rifles. This entailed various hijinks including
transporting a large decommissioned bombshell through the subway and weathering
many late-night details in Greek diners around Rose Hill.

During college Richard worked various summer jobs, including a night-shift
janitorial detail in the offices of a phone company. He would later reminisce
about time spent listening to classical music alone during those cool summer
nights. He also had a brief stint delivering seasonal mail for the USPS; during
his first shift, he was scolded by veteran mailmen for completing the day's
work too early.

After graduating from Fordham, he went on to obtain a Master's degree in
mathematics from St. John's University, finishing in 1972. He immediately
entered the US Army as a second lieutenant in the air defense artillery. At his
time of entrance the Vietnam war was winding down, and the Army was scaling
back. He was offered a return to civilian life in exchange for a number of
years in the Army Reserves, which he accepted.

He joined Electronic Data Systems (EDS), a pioneering IT firm in Plano, TX, as
a systems engineer. This was a role uniquely suited for him: it required the
presence and synthesis of low-level programming skill, keen business analysis,
and agreeable temperament. 

EDS sent him around the world to develop systems. After Texas, he was sent to
San Francisco, where he resided for a year*, and subsequently London, where he
played a pivotal role in Bank of America's integration with the SWIFT network,
a state-of-the-art system used to exchange financial data. In London he met the
woman who would be his first wife, Elizabeth Brower, and traveled prodigiously
across the European continent.  These travels would enrich not only his life,
but later on those of his family.

While with EDS, Richard traveled for a number of assignments in places like
Mexico City, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and Hong Kong — where he ran not
only a marathon but also with the Hash House Harriers. He would eventually
return to New York City, where he resided until moving south to Virginia.

Eventually, Richard parted ways with EDS and took a teaching position at
George Mason University. In many ways, this position as a mathematics 
instructor would shape his life. 

He and his wife moved into a house in Reston, Virginia, and produced his first
three children.
