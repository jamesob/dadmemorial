Richard Coleman O'Beirne was born in The Bronx, New York City in 1948 to James
"Lad" O'Beirne, a carpenter and musician of note, and Mary (n√©e Coleman)
O'Beirne, a nurse, both Irish immigrants from County Sligo. When Richard was
eight years old, his parents moved the family moved to Woodside, Queens due to
increasing turbulence in the Bronx. Richard showed an early and strong aptitude
for mathematics -- while serving detention for tardiness in grade school,
Richard would, standing, read math books to help the time pass.

He attended Arch Bishop Molloy High School in Briarwood, Queens. During 
high school he worked part-time as a paper boy, rising early in the mornings
to assemble newspapers in an empty grocery store. 

After graduating Molloy in 1966, he attended Fordham University to pursue
studies in mathematics. While at Fordham, Richard was an ROTC recruit and a
member of the Pershing Rifles, which entailed various hijinks, including
transporting a large decommisioned bombshell through the subway and weathering
many late-night details in Greek diners around Rose Hill. 

During college Richard worked various summer jobs, including a night-shift
janitorial detail in the offices of a phone company. He used to reminisce to me
about time spent listening to classical music alone during those cool summer
nights. He also had a brief stint delivering seasonal mail for the USPS; during
his first shift, he was scolded by veteran mailmen for completing the day's
work too early.

After graduating from Fordham, he went on to obtain a Master's degree in
Mathematics from St. John's university, graduating in 1972. He immediately
entered the US Army as a second lieutenant in the air defense artillery. At his
time of entrance, the Vietnam war was winding down, and the Army was scaling
back. He was offered a return to civilian life in exchange for a number of
years in the Army Reserves, which he accepted.

He quickly interviewed for and received a position with Electronic Data Systems
(EDS), a pioneering IT firm in Plano, TX, as a systems engineer. This was a
role uniquely suited for him: it required the presence and synthesis of
low-level programming chops, keen business analysis, and personable demeanor.
By every account, he excelled in this position.

So much so that he was sent to San Francisco, where he resided for a year*, and
subsequently London, where he played a hand in Bank of America's integration
with the SWIFT network, a state-of-the-art system used to exchange financial
data. In London he met the woman who would be his first wife, Elizabeth Brower,
and traveled prodigiously across the European continent. These travels would
enrich not only his life, but those of his children and spouses. 

While with EDS, Richard traveled for a number of assignments in places like
Mexico City, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and Hong Kong (where he first ran with
the infamous Hash House Harriers). He would eventually return to New York City
where he resided until moving down to Virginia.
